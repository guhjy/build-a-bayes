The Build-A-Bayes dashboard is a **toy**.  It is accompanied by a paper and serves only to illustrate the concepts therein. **There are almost certainly errors in the computations used here.**

This app is not a research tool and should not be used as such.  To compute Bayes factors and posterior probabilities for research data, please use [JASP](jasp-stats.org).

We will probably tweak and revamp this app over time, so it might change appearance and functionality at any time and without notice.  The code is released under a GPLv3 license, which is linked in the menu bar.
